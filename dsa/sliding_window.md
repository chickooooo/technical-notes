### Prefix Sum + Hash Map (Subarray Sum Pattern)

Overview:
- This pattern is used to count the number of subarrays with a given sum `k`.
- Works for arrays with **positive, zero, or negative** numbers.

Key Properties:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n) (to store prefix sums)
- Supports negative numbers (unlike sliding window which usually requires non-negative numbers).

Core Idea:
- Maintain a hashmap: `{prefix_sum: count}` to store how often each prefix sum occurs.
- For each element:
    - Update running `prefix_sum`.
    - Check if `prefix_sum - k` exists in the map â†’ this indicates a subarray summing to k.
    - Add the count of `prefix_sum - k` to the answer.
    - Update the map with the current `prefix_sum`.

Use Cases:
- Algorithmic problems:
    - Count subarrays with sum = k
    - Count binary subarrays with sum = k
    - Find max length subarray with sum = k
    - Subarray Sums Divisible by K
- Real-World Applications:
    - Detect periods where cumulative profit/loss equals a target.

## Problems:

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Max consecutive ones after k flips
- Simple variable sliding window problem.
- The window increases while `1` or `k > 0`.
- The window shrinks till we get a flip to move on.
- Handle `k = 0` edge case.
- Use `queue` data structure for `O(1)` shrinking.

<br>

### Longest substring after k replacements
- Variable sliding window problem.
- Create a frequency array to track frequencies.
- If the current element is `majority` element, increase the window.
- If replacements available, increase the window.
- Otherwise, shrink the window.
- Time complexity: O(n*26)
- Space compelxity: O(26)

### Longest substring without repeating characters
- Problem: Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.
- Simple variable sliding window problem.
- The window increases while `jth` element is not in `hashset`.
- The window decreases while `jth` element is in `hashset`.
- While decreasing, the `ith` element is removed from the hashset.

### Binary subarrays matching the sum

- Problem: Given a binary array nums and an integer goal, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum goal.

---

- **Algorithm**: Prefix sum + hash map
- Prefix sum sliding window problem.
- Maintain a hashmap of `{prefix_sum: count}`.
- At each step, count the number of subarrays with sum equal to `prefix - k`.
- Update hashmap for current `prefix_sum`.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Subarrays containing k odd numbers
- Problem: Given an array of integers nums and an integer k. Return the number of continuous subarrays that contains k odd numbers.

---
- **Algorithm**: Simplify the given problem to a simpler problem. Fixed size sliding window.
- Create a new list containing all odd indexes.
- Perform fixed sized (k) sliding window on this list.
- At each step,
    - left = no. of even numbers to the left (after last odd number)
    - right = no. of even numbers to the right (before next odd number)
    - Add all combinations `1 + left + right + left*right` to the total

```
2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 2   |   k=3
      ___________
         window
-----             ---
 left            right
```

### Substrings containing a,b,c atleast once

- Problem: Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c. Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

---

- **Algorithm**: Variable sliding window + Counting at each step.
- Use 2 pointers `i & j`.
- Increment `j` till you find the first window containing `a,b,c`.
- This window and all the windows to the right (by increasing `j`) are valid. Add this count to `total`.
- Now decrement `i`. If the window is valid, add the same above count to `total`.
- Continue decrement of `i` till the window becomes invalid.
- Again start from 2nd step.

### Count subarrays with given XOR

- Problem: Given an array of integers arr[] and a number k, count the number of subarrays having XOR of their elements as k.
- Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-subarray-with-given-xor/1

---

- **Algorithm**: Prefix sum + hash map
- Maintain a hashmap of `{prefix_xor: count}`. Set `hashmap[0] = 1`.
- At each step, perform XOR with current element and update the value of `prefix_xor`.
- Count the number of subarrays with XOR equal to `prefix_xor ^ k`.
- Increment the count of current `prefix_xor` in the hashmap.
